**COMP-4740 Project 1** 

Submitted by: Saffa Alvi, Nour ElKott

This repository contains the source code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model that is applied to the MNIST dataset. In order to test this code, Tensorflow needs to be installed. <br>
- _CNN_Model.py_ - the source code for our CNN model implementation. Tested by running `python3 CNN_Model.py`
- _CNN_Model.ipynb_ - a Jupyter notebook file that contains the outputs and some notes for our model
- _VGG_Model.ipynb_ -  a Jupyter notebook file that contains the source code to test the existing VGG model and outputs for comparison to our CNN.
- _Dense_Model.ipynb_ -  a Jupyter notebook file that contains the source code to test a model that consists of Dense layers for comparison to our CNN.
